# Transformer Insight Tool

## Overview

This repository contains code for Transformer Insight Tool which utilizes a Transformer-based test model. The tool extracts last hidden state vectors and confidence scores for adequate splicing predictions.

## Features

- **Last Hidden State Extraction:** The code extracts the last hidden state vectors from the Transformer-based model, which are later used for a detailed representation of the input sequences.

- **Confidence Score Calculation:** In addition to hidden states, the tool extracts confidence scores for splicing predictions, offering insights into the model's level of certainty.
